React Questions & Answers

1. What is JSX, and why is it used in React?

ANSWRE:JSX lets us write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. It makes React code easier to write.

2. What is the difference between props and state?

ANSWRE:Props are used to send data from a parent to a child. State is used to store data that can change.

3. What does the useState hook do, and where did you use it in this project?

ANSWRE:useState stores data and updates the UI when the data changes. I used it to manage the selected technologies.

4. What does the useEffect hook do, and why did you need it to load the JSON data?

ANSWRE:ANSWRE:useEffect runs some code after the component renders. It can be used to load JSON data when the page starts.

5. Why does every item in a .map() list need a unique key prop?

ANSWRE:The key helps React identify each item in the list. It helps React update the list correctly.

6. What is conditional rendering? Show one place you used it.

ANSWRE:Conditional rendering means showing something based on a condition.

I used it to show a message when the stack is empty.

{selectedTechnology.length === 0 ? (

  <p>Your stack is empty.</p>
) : (
  // show stack items
)}


7. How do you pass data from a parent component to a child component, and how does a child send something back to the parent?

ANSWRE:A parent sends data to a child using props. A child can send data back by using a function passed through props.
